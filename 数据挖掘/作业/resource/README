Python Notebook Installation:

It is recommended to install Python environments using Anaconda.

1) Install Anaconda:
    Download and install from the installer suitable to your environment (Window/Mac/Linux):
        https://www.anaconda.com/download/
        
    It is recommended to use Python 3.

2) Create a new Python environment with Anaconda: 
   
   Sometimes, you will need different versions of Python, or different versions of Python packages for different projects. 
   Python environment create an isolated environment for your project.
   
   The following guides you how to create a new Python environment with conda:
   https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
   
3) Install Jupyter:
   Suppose that you have created an conda environment called PY3 from the previous step, you can activate it by 
   
   conda activate PY3
   
   Install Jupyter in the activated environment:   

   $(PY3) pip install jupyter
   
   Similarly, install other required packages:
	numpy
        scipy
        scikit-learn
        pandas
        matplotlib.pyplot
        pylab
        scipy
	seaborn

  
  
   Run Jupyter notebook from the folder containing your notebooks *.ipynb:
   $(PY3) jupyter notebook
